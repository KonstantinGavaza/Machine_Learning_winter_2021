Course project 
"The study of the comparative efficiency of various methods of machine learning to solve an applied problem"
 (result - report or a draft of a scientific article)
1.	Select a task:
Choose a topic according to the theme of your Master research in the University (preferable) or select from the list below:
A) “Prediction of reactions to informational messages in social networks”.
The purpose of the work is to predict the reaction to newly published messages using the user reaction history to previously published informational messages. Depending on the initial data set, such signs as: socio-demographic features of users, network structure of friendship / subscriptions, content of informational message, etc. can be used.
 Examples of datasets https://gengo.ai/datasets/12best-social-media-datasets/.
B) “Modeling and forecasting the visits to points of interest”
Purpose of the work - according to the available historical data to build a forecast of customer flows to various offices / supermarkets, etc., depending on the geographical location of points, customer categories, customer preferences, etc.
Examples of datasets:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data
C) “Modeling and forecasting consumer activity in retail”
Purpose of the work - according to the available historical data to build a forecast of consumer activity in relation to purchases of certain goods, categories of goods, to form customer preferences and / or the best shopping basket for a given retailer.
Examples of datasets: (see “B” case).
2. Build a mathematical formalization of the problem.
3. Produce a literary review of scientific articles describing the solution of similar tasks / machine learning algorithms that can be used to solve the problem (at least 10 articles, of which at least 5 are not older than 5 years).
4. Based on the overview, select at least 5 methods / algorithms of machine learning to study the comparative effectiveness of the methods. If the report form is a draft of a scientific article, then among the selected methods there should be those that have not yet been used to solve this problem.
5. Search for open source datasets, at least three, on which the solution of the problem could be tested.
6. Describe the quality metrics by which the solution of the problem can be assessed.
7. Compare the results of various algorithms with respect to the quality metrics of p. 6.
8. Make a conclusion about which algorithm gives the best results for the task.
9. Report form:
Report in English 10-15 pages (introduction, related work, problem statement, description of methods, (preprocessing, quality measures, experiments), conclusion).
